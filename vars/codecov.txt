<strong>codecov(credsName=null)</strong>

<p>Submits coverage information to codecov.io using their <a href="https://codecov.io/bash">bash script</a>.</p>
<p>
<code>credsName</code> is optional:
<ul>
    <li>
        <p>if not specified, the repository name and owner are extracted from the repository URL, and joined with a "-". if the owner is "docker", it is dropped.</p>
        <p>examples:<ul>
            <li>docker/docker.git becomes docker</li>
            <li>docker/swarm.git becomes swarm</li>
            <li>mikedougherty/swarm becomes mikedougherty-swarm</li>
        </ul></p>
    </li>
    <li><p>if specified, it is used directly.</p></li>
</ul>
The result of this is then combined with the suffix <code>.codecov-token</code>
(e.g.: <code>swarm.codecov-token</code>) and used to look up a "secret text"
credentials item which is used to submit the codecov token. Please contact your
Jenkins administrator if you need credentials added to the system for your project.
